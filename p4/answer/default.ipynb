    "Computation of Energy Scores: The calcAlpha function was updated to compute energy scores by first expanding the decoder hidden state across the sequence length of the encoder outputs to align their dimensions. We then apply the encoder and decoder linear transformations (W_enc and W_dec) to their respective inputs and sum these transformed outputs. The tanh activation function is applied to this sum, followed by another linear transformation (V_att) to produce energy scores. These scores represent the alignment between the encoder outputs and the current decoder hidden state, indicating how much attention to pay to each encoder output at the current decoding step.\n",

    "Softmax to Calculate Attention Weights: We apply a softmax function to the energy scores along the sequence dimension. This operation converts the scores into a probability distribution (attention weights, alpha), indicating the relative importance of each encoder output in the context of the current decoder state.\n",

    "Context Vector Calculation: In the forward method, using the calculated attention weights (alpha), we compute the context vector as a weighted sum of the encoder outputs. This context vector synthesizes the information from the encoder outputs, weighted by their relevance to the current step in the decoding process."
